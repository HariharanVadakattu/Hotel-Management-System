# Hotel-Management-System 

The main objective is to create a centralized system for a chain of hotels.
Centralized System contains all the rates of each hotel room depending on whether it is peak season/offseason. 
Customer must pay the bill during check-out for all the services used.
Customer can make reservations and pay before check-in. Cancellation charges will be applied if not canceled before check-in time. 
A single customer can have multiple reservations in a single booking. customers can check out whenever they want to, but extending their stay is subject to availability.
Customers can update their reservations before checkin.
